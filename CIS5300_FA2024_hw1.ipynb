        "# Homework 1: Text Classification\n",
        "## Due Date: Mon, Sep 16, 2024, 11:59 PM EST\n",
        "- **Overview**: For this assignment, we’ll be building a text classifier. The goal of our text classifer will be to distinguish between words that are simple and words that are complex. Example simple words are `heard`, `sat`, and `town`, and example complex words are `abdicate`, `detained`, and `vintners`. Distinguishing between simple and complex words is the first step in a larger NLP task called text simplification, which aims to replace complex words with simpler synonyms. Text simplification is potentially useful for re-writing texts so that they can be more easily understood by younger readers, people learning English as a second language, or people with learning disabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Learning goals**:\n",
        "    - Understand an important class of NLP evaluation methods (precision, recall and F1), and implement them yourself.\n",
        "    - Employ common experimental design practices in NLP. Split the annotated data into training/development/test sets, implement simple baselines to determine how difficult the task is, and experiment with a range of features and models.\n",
        "    - Get an introduction to `sklearn`, an excellent machine learning Python package.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data**: We will provide you with training and development data that has been manually labeled. We will also give you a test set without labels. You will build a classifier to predict the labels on our test set. You can upload your classifier’s predictions to Gradescope. We will score its predictions and maintain a leaderboard showing whose classifier has the best performance.\n",
